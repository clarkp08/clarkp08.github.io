	<p>I'm Phil. I'm from Virginia. I went to East Carolina University. I played baseball for the Pirates. I moved to Raleigh after I graduated. I worked in insurance for 3 years. Hated it. Now I'm learning how to code. I'm also working at a soccer store (Premier Soccer) that is opening up in July on Glenwood Ave. Drop in and say hello, and buy something!</p>
